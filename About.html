        <p class="j">Hi it's nice to meet you! My name is Ajayi Oluwaseyi known as <i>Lazzy</i> in the photography world. I'm a fine-art, commercial, documentary and event photographer based in Western part of Nigeria (Lagos state). I've been photographing for almost 10 years. </p>
        <p class="j">It all started on the day of my graduation where I met RKV designer who took me under his wing to help him out in his studio. After a year of working with RKV, he encourage me to pick up a camera and he started teaching me all the aspect of photography. After some years of learning and working together  where we go out for documentary, commercial and event photography I started getting courage and motivated. </p>
        <p class="j">After  3 years of learning from him i was given a work permit then I started my own little world, runing a studio now called <i>Lazzylens photography studio</i> where i welcome people to shoot them in different styles and also go out for commercial and event photography where people invite me to  occasions like birthday ceremony, wedding ceremony etc. to come and shoot them. </p>
        <p class="j">My work places people in exaggerated situations that highlight an aspect of who they are. I look for a sense defiance and fortitude in my work</p>
        <p class="j">Photography is my passion, nature is my refuge. Combine the two, and that is where I am most at peace.</p>
